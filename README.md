# **ChatGPT Telegram Bot**

This is a Telegram bot that uses the ChatGPT language model from OpenAI to generate responses to user messages. The bot listens for messages from users and uses the OpenAI API to generate a response, which is then sent back to the user via Telegram.

## Usage

To use the bot, simply send a message to the bot on Telegram. The bot will automatically generate a response based on the message you sent. You can use the bot to have a conversation, ask questions, or just have some fun!

## Examples

Here are some examples of the bot in action:

### Example 1

User: Hello, how are you?

Bot: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I help you today?

### Example 2

User: What's the meaning of life?

Bot: The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been debated by scholars and thinkers for centuries. Some believe that the meaning of life is to seek happiness and fulfillment, while others believe that it is to fulfill a specific purpose or destiny. What do you believe?
